Using Onionshare on Ubuntu/Windows, one can host their own temporary TOR static website with a .onion link

You can further go down the rabbit hole and use a vanity custom domain and add a cusotm initial character set( something like lorddemonort3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion ) to your onion domain and host it on a persistent server/cloud for lifelong access
